# Travel Tracker 

## Project Overview

**Travel Tracker** is a dynamic web application that allows users to mark the countries they’ve visited on a world map using their chosen color. It offers a simple yet interactive way to visually track your global travels. In addition to personal maps, users can add friends and view their friends’ travel maps to see which countries they’ve visited. This makes Travel Tracker not just a personal travel log, but a shared experience platform.

## Project Files Description

1. **solution.js** – The main JavaScript file that handles core client-side functionalities including color selection, map interactions, and triggering updates when a country is selected.
2. **index.ejs** – The main template file that renders the home page, where users can enter their name, choose a color, and start interacting with the map.
3. **new.ejs** – Template file for the "Add Friends" page, where users can search for friends and view their travel maps.
4. **main.css** – Stylesheet for the home page that styles the form, layout, and interactive elements.
5. **new.css** – Stylesheet for the friends page, ensuring a clean and user-friendly experience when viewing or managing friends.

## Features

-**Personalized Country Selection**:  
  Users can select a color and click on any country on the world map to mark it as visited. The selected country changes to the chosen color.

-**Interactive World Map**:  
  A full world map is displayed, allowing users to interact with it and track their travels visually.

-**Add and View Friends**:  
  Users can add friends by name and see their travel maps. This enables comparison and shared travel stories.

- **Persistent User Data**:  
  All country selections and user data are stored securely in a PostgreSQL database, so information remains intact across sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js & Express.js** – Used for building the server-side application and handling routing.
- **EJS** – Embedded JavaScript templating engine used to dynamically render HTML pages with server-side data.
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database used for storing user profiles, friends, and country selections.
- **HTML & CSS** – Used to structure and style the front-end interface.
- **JavaScript** – Used on the client side to handle user interactions and manipulate the world map interface in real time.

## Dataset / User Input

All data in the Travel Tracker application is generated by users:

- Users manually input their name.
- They choose a color using a color picker.
- They click on countries they’ve visited, which are then stored in the database with their selected color.
- They can also search and add friends, whose maps are also stored and viewable.

## Future Scope

-**User Login and Authentication**:  
  Implement user authentication so each user has a secure account to manage their travel map.

-**Real-Time Map Sharing**:  
  Enable real-time updates so that when a user changes their map, any connected friends can instantly see the updated version if they’re linked.
